                <h3>Ronnie Bylicki</h3>
                <p>Hey everyone, my name is Ronnie. I am the current leader of Tempo Storm’s CS:GO team and a regular streamer on twitch.tv. I started playing Counter-Strike in the summer of 2003, but I didn't play competitively until 2006 when I found discovered ESEA and became the player I am today. A quote that I live by is "Be humble, hungry, and always be the hardest worker in the room." My love for CS:GO is hard to match, I always give 110% whether I'm playing for fun or gunning for first place in the grand finals of a tournament. My role on the team is the main fragger, but I also play a variety of positions on each map allowing me to run around and make plays. I am also second in line (behind stanislaw) to be the IGL (In Game Leader). Over the last few years I have played  ESEA-invite a total of 4 seasons. During this time I won ESEA-main twice, placed second in ESEA-main, and won ESEA-open while remaining undefeated.</p>

                <h3>Peter Jarguz</h3>
                <p>Stanislaw first began playing competitive CS in 2012 towards the end of the 1.6 era. Upon the release of CSGO, he slowly transitioned and adapted to the new style of gameplay and began competing competitively once again in 2014. This was a standout year for Stanislaw, as he led his former team to an ESEA-IM championship, a 2nd place finish at the ESWC Montreal LAN Qualifier, as well as an invite to the first ever ESEA-P division. It was during this season where he established himself as one of the most consistent players in the division.</br>
</br>
It wasn’t long before he was approached by an ESEA-Invite team, where he gained valuable experience against some of the best talent in North America. Stanislaw’s stint in Invite only lasted a short while, and soon after joined forces with ryx & company in ESEA-P, helping them achieve 1st place with an undefeated record of 19-0. Now Stanislaw is once again at the highest level of competitive CSGO, competing against the best players in North America with team Tempo Storm.</p>

                <p>I play the role of in game-Leader for the team. I've been playing the CS franchise on and off for the last 8 years, but started playing seriously in the past 2. I have a ton of passion for the game and very high aspirations, I won't be satisfied until my team is competing in the major tournaments. I have been competing against the top North American teams for a while now, and I truly believe this team will make it to where we want to be.</p>

                <p>Hey my name is Mitchell MacInnis and I have been playing Counter Strike competitively for 9 years. I started my career in Counter Strike 1.6 and made it up to CAL-Main with React.cs. I've played hockey my whole life at a top level and I thrive for competition. When CS:GO came out I practiced a lot and competed against the best teams in North America. My most notable teams were Savage, Reliable Gaming Canada, Momentus, Exertus eSports, and The Destruction Box 9000. My past experience is ESEA-Invite and CEVO-Professional. Some of the recent lans I have attended include a 2nd place finish at Toronto OCN 2014, 2nd at ETS Montreal 2015 and 1st at Lanwar in Toronto 2015 , 2nd place ESEA-Main Season 14.</p>

                <p>My role on the team is the entry fragger and secondary awper. I have been playing CS steadily since 2006 where I started as a pubber, and worked my ways through the ranks. I have always believed that hard work pays off, and will earn you respect as a player.  When CS:GO came out I didn’t pick the game up right away, instead focused on other priorities in my life.  For the first year I didn’t even log 10 hours total.  As time went on I saw the potential of CS:GO and realized how much I enjoyed competing in the counter-strike franchise, so I dedicated myself to the game.  At first, no one took me seriously and I struggled to find a team. I can’t stress enough to those trying to get into the competitive scene: hard work pays off. I earned my spot back playing on competitive teams through the time and effort I put back into the game.  I’ve always been considered the “young gunner” on all of my teams, but now with CS:GO getting huge -- it’s the opposite.  I’m considered the veteran player on the team who has tons of experience playing in super competitive / high stress matches.  I keep the team under control and make sure that we stick it out to the end if we’re behind, and keeping everyone in check when we’re ahead to make sure we close out the match without getting antsy.</p>
