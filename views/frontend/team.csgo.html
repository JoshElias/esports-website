                <h3>Ronnie Bylicki</h3>
                <p>Hey everyone, my name is Ronnie. I am the current leader of Tempo Storm’s CS:GO team and a regular streamer on twitch.tv. I started playing Counter-Strike in the summer of 2003, but I didn't play competitively until 2006 when I found discovered ESEA and became the player I am today. A quote that I live by is "Be humble, hungry, and always be the hardest worker in the room." My love for CS:GO is hard to match, I always give 110% whether I'm playing for fun or gunning for first place in the grand finals of a tournament. My role on the team is the main fragger, but I also play a variety of positions on each map allowing me to run around and make plays. I am also second in line (behind stanislaw) to be the IGL (In Game Leader). Over the last few years I have played  ESEA-invite a total of 4 seasons. During this time I won ESEA-main twice, placed second in ESEA-main, and won ESEA-open while remaining undefeated.</p>

                <h3>Peter Jarguz</h3>
                <p>I have played the Counter-Strike Franchise for over 12 years. I began my career as a Counter-Strike 1.6 player where I was a semi-competitive player for a few years. A year after CS:GO’s beta release I transitioned over and began working hard to make it to the next level, leading to my first title a few months later (ESEA-Intermediate season 16 – with team SYNRGY). Soon after I attended my first event as a team (ESWC North American Qualifier in Montreal Canada) where we finished 2nd against the previous #1 team iBUYPOWER (AZK, DaZed, Steel, Swag, Skadoodle). We were then nominated to participate in the first-ever Premier Division for CS:GO in ESEA.  I had a standout season where I was consistently on top of the statistical leaderboards. My performances did not go unnoticed, and I was soon approached by a team in the ESEA-Invite division (the highest tier of CS:GO in North America). I joined team SKDC and gained some valuable experience at the top level (including attending Clutchcon Lan in Colorado) before finally moving to my current team – Tempo Storm.</p>

                <h3>Max Gallagher</h3>
                <p>I started playing Counter-Strike: Source around the age of 13, and loved every minute of it. I played casually for a long time, but once I made the switch to competitive play I quickly reached invite level. Shortly after placing 3rd at the ESEA LAN CS:GO was released and I made the switch. Soon thereafter I won ESEA Main, and I am currently undefeated in ESEA Premier. I have always been a naturally competitive person and I continually strive to improve in any way I can. I am known for my precise, fast paced, and in your face AWPing playstyle.</p>

                <p>Hey my name is Mitchell MacInnis and I have been playing Counter Strike competitively for 9 years. I started my career in Counter Strike 1.6 and made it up to CAL-Main with React.cs. I've played hockey my whole life at a top level and I thrive for competition. When CS:GO came out I practiced a lot and competed against the best teams in North America. My most notable teams were Savage, Reliable Gaming Canada, Momentus, Exertus eSports, and The Destruction Box 9000. My past experience is ESEA-Invite and CEVO-Professional. Some of the recent lans I have attended include a 2nd place finish at Toronto OCN 2014, 2nd at ETS Montreal 2015 and 1st at Lanwar in Toronto 2015 , 2nd place ESEA-Main Season 14.</p>

                <h3>Ricky Cohen</h3>
                <p>My role on the team is the entry fragger and secondary awper. I have been playing CS steadily since 2006 where I started as a pubber, and worked my ways through the ranks. I have always believed that hard work pays off, and will earn you respect as a player.  When CS:GO came out I didn’t pick the game up right away, instead focused on other priorities in my life.  For the first year I didn’t even log 10 hours total.  As time went on I saw the potential of CS:GO and realized how much I enjoyed competing in the counter-strike franchise, so I dedicated myself to the game.  At first, no one took me seriously and I struggled to find a team. I can’t stress enough to those trying to get into the competitive scene: hard work pays off. I earned my spot back playing on competitive teams through the time and effort I put back into the game.  I’ve always been considered the “young gunner” on all of my teams, but now with CS:GO getting huge -- it’s the opposite.  I’m considered the veteran player on the team who has tons of experience playing in super competitive / high stress matches.  I keep the team under control and make sure that we stick it out to the end if we’re behind, and keeping everyone in check when we’re ahead to make sure we close out the match without getting antsy.</p>
