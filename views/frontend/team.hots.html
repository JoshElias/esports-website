Some of his favorites were Super Mario Brothers and Paperboy. He later received a N64 and loved games like Banjo Kazooie and Super Smash Brothers. Wade moved to a campground for a summer where he played copious amounts of Tekken 2 and moved on to first truly realize competitive games when he moved on to Halo 2. From there he progressed to WoW, from Wrath to Cataclysm and secured an exceptional arena rating. He also achieved diamond league in Starcraft 2 despite not even playing it often. Wade started League of Legends around the time the champion "Vayne" came out and got to platinum for both seasons 2 and 3. He now joins Heroes of the Storm as a deadly support and one of the team's fiercest competitors.</p>
