                    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Jeffrey "Axe" Williamson, and I have been playing Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively since 2006. I am most well known for being the world's best Pikachu player and having a fast/aggressive playstyle. My goal is not only to be the best at my main character, but to prove that I can be the best player and to represent Tempo Storm to the fullest. Thanks to all of the support I get from my friends here in Arizona, I've climbed up the rankings to become the state's best player, as well as one of the top players in the world. It doesn't stop there though. With the help I get from Tempo Storm and all of our fans, it only pushes me to become that much better!</p>

                    <p>Hey Guys, my name is Weston (WestBallz) Dennis and I main Falco in SSBM. I've been playing competitive Melee since 2010. By mid 2014 I was finally considered a top 10 player and since then I've been beating some of the best players in the world. I love competing and I won't stop until I put Tempo Storm at the top of Competitive Smash Bros.

                    <p>I'm Reepal "Rip" Parbhoo and I've been involved in the fighting game community since the late 90's. I've competed since 2005 with my main accomplishment being Top 3 at Evolution 3 years in a row for Tekken 6 and getting to compete internationally for that game as well. Aside from competing I've cast: Tekken, Injustice, and Killer Instinct for MLG and Evolution over the years. As a strategy guide author for Prima Games, I had the opportunity to co-author the Tekken Tag 2, Killer Instinct, and Smash 4 strategy guides. I look to use these experiences, plus my attention to detail, to help Tempo Storm's FGC Team grow and prosper!
