                <h3>Peter Jarguz</h3>
                <p>Stanislaw first began playing competitive CS in 2012 towards the end of the 1.6 era. Upon the release of CSGO, he slowly transitioned and adapted to the new style of gameplay and began competing competitively once again in 2014. This was a standout year for Stanislaw, as he led his former team to an ESEA-IM championship, a 2nd place finish at the ESWC Montreal LAN Qualifier, as well as an invite to the first ever ESEA-P division. It was during this season where he established himself as one of the most consistent players in the division.</br>
</br>
It wasn’t long before he was approached by an ESEA-Invite team, where he gained valuable experience against some of the best talent in North America. Stanislaw’s stint in Invite only lasted a short while, and soon after joined forces with ryx & company in ESEA-P, helping them achieve 1st place with an undefeated record of 19-0. Now Stanislaw is once again at the highest level of competitive CSGO, competing against the best players in North America with team Tempo Storm.</p>
