                <h3>Andrey Yanyuk</h3>
                <p>Perhaps the most influential and controversial person in Hearthstone’s short competitive history, Reynad is often touted jokingly as “the creator of all Hearthstone decks” due to the nature of his incredible deck building prowess and salty demeanor. Known as the father of infamous decks such as Zoolock, Mad Scientist Hunter, and the free-to-play Burn Warrior, there is little doubt the meta-game would be in a much different place without his innovation.<br><br>Despite having a reputation as one of the unluckiest tournament players, Reynad is still a well-accomplished player placing top 4 in Dreamhack and winning multiple online tournaments such as Battle of the Best. When he is not competing, he is often seen streaming to tens of thousands of fans, working on Tempo Storm, and moonlighting as a manager of a contemporary jazz band, Ritzy Who.</p>

                <p>Hailing from Bosnia, Gaara is one of the most accomplished and respected tournament players in all of competitive Hearthstone. Scouted as promising talent prior to Hearthstone's full release, Gaara exploded onto the tournament scene by winning Dreamhack Bucharest with Ramp Druid at a time when Hunters were thought to be the best deck by a far margin.<br><br>Gaara is known for his strong tournament play, friendly demeanor, and challenging the meta game with unique card choices. He finished 2014 as one of the top 5 earners in Hearthstone with multiple online cup wins, two Dreamhack finals, and a Bronze finish at WCA. Through the good times and bad, his favorite class since beta has always been Priest, but don’t be surprised to see him whip out another surprise class for an event!</p>

                <p>Hyped was an unknown prospect heading in the summer of 2014 before having a breakout ladder performance topping the season at #2 and #3 respectively with two different accounts. Since then, he has been respected as a ladder deity, always pushing the top ranks effortlessly with his iconic decks which has defined the meta-game time and time again.<br><br>Considered one of the premier Rogue and Mage players, Hyped is well known for making strong plays thinking four or five steps in advance. He has yet to have a true tournament breakout performance, but most players agree -- he is one of the most feared opponents to match up against in any competitive arena.</p>
